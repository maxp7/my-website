        <p> Hi, I'm Maksym Pidluzhnyi, and I'm passionate about web development and immersive technologies. As a student researcher at the Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft (HTW) in Berlin, I work on projects that blend technical expertise with creative solutions. <br /><br />

I've gained experience in various technologies and participated in international exhibitions, which have helped me quickly adapt to new challenges and find effective solutions. The project "Tactile Musical Interfaces" installation showcased at the ARS Electronica Festival, reflects my commitment to creating inclusive and interactive experiences. <br /> <br />

I'm fluent in German, English, Russian, and Ukrainian, and I use my skills in JavaScript, React, and Unity to bring complex projects to life. I'm currently seeking a junior web developer role where I can apply my skills and contribute to innovative projects.</p>
